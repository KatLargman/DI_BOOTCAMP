Create a database called bootcamp.
CREATE DATABASE bootcamp

Create a table called students.
Add the following columns: id last_name first_name birth_date. The id must be auto_incremented. Make sure to choose the correct data type for each column. To help, here is the data that you will have to insert. (How do we insert a date to a table?)
CREATE TABLE students( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, first_name TEXT, last_name TEXT, birth_date DATE)

Insert the data seen above to the students table. Find the most efficient way to insert the data.
INSERT INTO students(first_name,last_name,birth_date) VALUES ('Marc','Benichou','02/11/1998'), ('Yoan','Cohen','03/12/2010'), ('Lea','Benichou','27/07/1987'), ('Amelia','Dux','07/04/1996'), ('David','Grez','14/06/2003'), ('Omer','Simpson','03/10/1980')

Insert your last_name, first_name and birth_date to the students table (Take a look at the id given).
INSERT INTO students(first_name,last_name,birth_date) VALUES ('Yair','Zohar','06/12/1996')

Fetch all of the data from the table.
SELECT * FROM students

Fetch all of the students first_names and last_names.
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students

For the following questions, only fetch the first_names and last_names of the students:  Fetch the student which id is equal to 2. SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE id = 2

Fetch the student whose last_name is Benichou AND first_name is Marc. SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE first_name = 'Marc' AND last_name = 'Benichou'

Fetch the students whose last_name is Benichou OR first_name is Marc. SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE first_name = 'Marc' OR last_name = 'Benichou'

Fetch the students whose first_name contains the letter a. SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE first_name LIKE '%a%'

Fetch the students whose first_name starts with the letter a. SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE first_name LIKE 'a%'

Fetch the students whose first_name ends with the letter a. SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE first_name LIKE '%a'

Fetch the students whose second to last letter of their first_names is a (Example: Leah). SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE first_name LIKE '%a_'

Fetch the students whose idâ€™s are equal to 1 AND 3 . SELECT first_name,last_name FROM students WHERE id = 3 OR id = 4

Fetch the students whose birth_dates are equal to or come after 1/01/2000. (show all their info).

SELECT * FROM students WHERE birth_date >= '01/01/2000'
